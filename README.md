# FluidDial-CYD: 
The CYD_Buttons Version has been optimised for FluidDial CNC Pendants with 3 physical buttons 
and a jog dial, and is designed to work with the FluidNC Firmware.

*** **This Firmware is a Work In-progress** ***

**Design Goals:**
Physical jog dial will only move the cnc machine when in the Jog & Homing screen. 
The 3 physical buttons that will always be:
* Red: e-stop
* Yellow: Pause Job
* Green: Cycle Start
